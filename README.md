# Obstacle-Avoiding-and-Auto-Parking-Car


Meet ✨ Za2zoo2a ✨

I'm happy to share that for our embedded course final project, our team has successfully created an autonomous car that can navigate its environment, avoid obstacles, and park itself.

Key Features:

▪️ Obstacle Avoidance: We used a front ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo that rotates 180 degrees. When the sensor detects an obstacle, it looks around to find a clear path and navigates accordingly. 🚗

▪️ Auto Parallel Parking: The car uses three ultrasonic sensors for parking: one on the side to find an available parking spot, and two other ultrasonic sensors (front and back) to help adjust and park the car accurately. 🅿️
